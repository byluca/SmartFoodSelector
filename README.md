## 🍴 **Make Smarter Food Choices with AI**  
**SmartFoodSelector** is here to revolutionize how we analyze and recommend food products! 🚀 Using cutting-edge AI, this project helps you:  
- 🤖 Group products into meaningful clusters.  
- 📊 Predict categories for new items.  
- 🧠 Estimate preferences with Bayesian Networks.  
- 🧩 Apply rules and constraints using Prolog.

## 🌟 **Project Highlights**

### 🛠️ **1. Clustering with AI**  
Group products by their nutritional profiles (e.g., high-protein snacks, low-calorie meals) using **k-Means**. Fine-tune clusters and visualize patterns with tools like **PCA**.

### 🧠 **2. Predictive Modeling**  
Use models like **Random Forest** to classify new products and predict their categories. Handle imbalances with techniques like **SMOTE**.

### 🔮 **3. Bayesian Networks**  
Predict user preferences, even with missing data, using probabilistic models built with **pgmpy**.

### 🧩 **4. Logical Reasoning with Prolog**  
Apply rules like:  
- "Exclude dairy for lactose-intolerant users."  
- "Find high-protein snacks."

## 💡 **What Makes It Cool**  
- 🌐 **Semantic Insights**: Enrich the dataset with ontologies for deeper analysis.  
- 🔍 **Dimensionality Reduction**: Improve clustering with PCA.  
- 🤖 **Advanced Models**: Experiment with ensemble techniques or neural networks.
