# 🥗 **SmartFoodSelector**

## 🍴 **Make Smarter Food Choices with AI**  
Ever wanted a system that helps you organize, classify, and recommend food products intelligently? Enter **SmartFoodSelector**! 🚀 Inspired by advanced AI techniques, this project brings cutting-edge tools to your grocery list.  

---

## 🎯 **What You'll Learn**  
By diving into **SmartFoodSelector**, you'll explore:  
- 🤖 **Unsupervised Learning**: Group food products into meaningful clusters.  
- 📊 **Supervised Learning**: Predict which category a new product belongs to.  
- 🧠 **Probabilistic Models**: Use Bayesian Networks to estimate user preferences.  
- 🧩 **Logical Reasoning**: Apply rules and constraints using Prolog.

## 🌟 **Project Overview**  
In this project, we’ll analyze food product data 🛒 to create an intelligent assistant. Here’s the breakdown:

### 🛠️ **Key Components**:
1. **Clustering with k-Means**: Group products by nutritional profiles (e.g., energy-rich, high-protein).  
2. **Predictive Modeling**: Suggest a category for unseen products using machine learning models.  
3. **Bayesian Networks**: Estimate how likely a product matches a user’s preferences, even with missing data.  
4. **Prolog Reasoning**: Answer symbolic queries like "Which products fit a lactose-free diet?"

## 🚀 **Features in Action**

### 🔍 **1. Dataset Creation**  
- Collect food product data with:  
  - Nutritional values (calories, fats, proteins, etc.).  
  - Ingredient details and allergen info.  
  - Categories like "snacks," "drinks," or "meals."  
- Use online sources like **OpenFoodFacts** APIs to build a rich dataset.  

---

### 📈 **2. Clustering with AI**  
- Group products into clusters (e.g., high-protein snacks, low-calorie meals) using **k-Means**.  
- Visualize clusters with **PCA** to uncover patterns.  
- Fine-tune the number of clusters with the "elbow method."  

---

### 🧠 **3. Predictive Intelligence**  
- Train models like **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression** to classify new products.  
- Evaluate models with metrics like **accuracy** and **F1-score**.  
- Address class imbalances using techniques like **SMOTE**.  

---

### 🔮 **4. Bayesian Networks**  
- Build a probabilistic model to predict preferences.  
- Handle missing data with conditional probabilities.  
- Use tools like **pgmpy** to construct and evaluate Bayesian Networks.  

---

### 🧩 **5. Prolog Integration**  
- Add a rule-based reasoning engine for symbolic queries.  
- Examples:  
  - “Exclude dairy products for lactose-intolerant users.”  
  - “Find products suitable for a high-protein diet.”  
- Combine probabilistic and logical reasoning for comprehensive recommendations.

## 💡 **Extensions & Ideas**  
Want to take it further? Try these ideas:  
- 🌐 **Semantic Enrichment**: Add knowledge from ontologies like FOODS.owl for deeper insights.  
- 🔍 **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use **PCA** to improve clustering and predictions.  
- 🤖 **Ensemble Models**: Experiment with neural networks or ensemble techniques for improved accuracy.
